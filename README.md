## freeCodeCamp Frontend Certification Projects

A React app using routing to showcase six different frontend projects.

# Quote Generator

Selects a random quote from an array.

# Markdown Editor

Allows the real-time formatting of text using Markdown syntax.

# Drum Machine

Play a drumpkit pressing the following keys in your keyboard:

Q, W, E
A, S, D
Z, X, C

# Calculator

Advanced project.

This project is two-fold.

On one end, it is an exact UI replica of an iPhone iOS calculator. The UI not only includes the visual elements, but also screen behavior when reaching more than 8 digits.

The logic program is all about JavaScript competence and using the state of the component to keep track of calculations to perform.

# Pomodoro

A pomodoro is a study technique where a user sets an amount of time free of distraction for focused attention.
The custom time is 25 minutes with a 5 minute break in between sessions.
This pomodoro counter can be adjusted to the user's preferences in both the study session and the break time.
At the end of a session a bell sound is played to indicate a break has begun.
The break timer starts automatically at this time and a sound is played at the end indicating the start of a new study session.
The clock prominently displays a second by second countdown until each event.

# SOL

Personal project.

This component simply keeps track of the Earth rotations since the day I was born.
It's how many days I have been alive. Today is my day number: XX,XXX
